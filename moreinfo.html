<p> The Chiefs of the Confederation of the United Tribes of New Zealand and the separate and independent Chiefs who have not become members of the Confederation cede to Her Majesty the Queen of England absolutely and without reservation all the rights and powers of Sovereignty which the said Confederation or Individual Chiefs respectively exercise or possess, or may be supposed to exercise or to possess over their respective Territories as the sole sovereigns thereof.</p>

<p> Her Majesty the Queen of England confirms and guarantees to the Chiefs and Tribes of New Zealand and to the respective families and individuals thereof the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which they may collectively or individually possess so long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession; but the Chiefs of the United Tribes and the individual Chiefs yield to Her Majesty the exclusive right of Preemption over such lands as the proprietors thereof may be disposed to alienate at such prices as may be agreed upon between the respective Proprietors and persons appointed by Her Majesty to treat with them in that behalf.</p>

<p>As Māori rights were violated and lands were wrongfully taken, anger grew over time. The cooperation and protection tenets of the treaty continue to be essential to New Zealand's legal framework and cultural norms but in spite of these obstacles.</p> <p>The Waitangi Tribunal's formation demonstrates the country's dedication to adressing historical wrongs and promoting peace.</p>
<p>Every year on February 6th, Waitangi Day is marked with tenderness as a reminder of the continuous struggle towards reconciliation and unity. </p>
<p>It's an opportunity for introspection, discussion, and reaffirmed dedication to preserving the treaty's tenets of respect, understanding, and collaboration between Māori and non-Māori communities. </p>
<p>The Treaty of Waitangi serves as a symbol of hope and togehterness for future generations as New Zealand navigates its common history and shapes its relationship with each other.</p>
